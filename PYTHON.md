# Python

### 9. Exception
An exception is an error that happens during execution of a program. When that
error occurs, Python generate an exception that can be handled, which avoids your program to crash. A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error.
- Exceptions are convenient in many ways for handling errors and special conditions in a program. When you think that you have a code which can produce an error then you can use exception handling. 
- You can raise an exception in your own program by using the raise exception statement. Raising an exception breaks current code execution and returns the exception back until it is handled.

**Exception Errors**
Below are some common *exception errors* used in python:

| Error | Explanation |
| ------ | ------ |
| IOError | If the file cannot be opened |
| ImportError | If python cannot find the module |
| ValueError | Raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value |
| KeyboardInterrupt |Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete) |
| EOFError | Raised when one of the built-in functions (input() or raw_input()) hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data |
